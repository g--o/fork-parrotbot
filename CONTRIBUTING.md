# Contributing
If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, feel free to create a new
issue on GitHub: https://github.com/mart-w/parrotbot

If you feel like contributing to the codebase itself, that is also appreciated!
Just fork the project, make your changes and file a pull request that describes
what you’ve done. Please try to write clean, understandable code and document it
as described in
[Python’s docstring conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#specification).
